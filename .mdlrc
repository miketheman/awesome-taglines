rules "~MD013", "~MD024"

## notes:
# MD013 https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/master/docs/RULES.md#md013---line-length
# This is one to work towards - by reformatting existing lines to be shorter
# than 80 characters. It's also a good indicator of a tagline - so it's
# possible that this rule may be re-introduced later.
#
# MD024 https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/master/docs/RULES.md#md024---multiple-headers-with-the-same-content
# Since we want to allow for a TOC headers for sub-categories of items
# under a grouping, such as "tools"->"python", "services"->"python" this
# rule is not as applicable. We also use `gh-md-toc` to generate the TOC
# and it should handle the duplication.
