# awesome-taglines [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of awesome taglines

This started as a fun exercise in comparing how programming languages, frameworks, and tools
express themselves at first glance.
Collecting them became a bit of a hobby, and is fun to compare and contrast!

Most taglines were sourced from the associated web pages. If you find a better, shorter version,
mistakes, or can help better categorize the content, please help improve this awesome list with
a [contribution](#contribute)!
